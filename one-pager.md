# AI Bayou

## Vision

* State welcomes technology companies and many companies are moving to
  NOLA[[1]](https://www.inc.com/emily-canal/why-entrepreneurs-leave-nyc-sf-for-austin-reno-miami.html)
  
* LSU (@BR?) is the state's flagship, leading in research and education. It is
  critical to keep the status. While even before COVID-19 crisis it was apparent
  that learning was shifting toward remote, now it is becoming clear that
  although remote learning works very well for training, but it is not as
  effective for education which requires more attention and guidance specially
  for younger students
  [[2]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA3-mLhajkk&list=PL2FF649D0C4407B30).
  This is one of the areas where AI can help by personalizing the education. The
  need is more immediate for states like Louisiana which are already facing the
  effects of the inclement weather and the interruptions it causes.

  * we have learned from the advancements of data science that the most
    important "ingredient" is reliable data. Therefore, **It is important to
    have the community as much involved in the process as possible**. BR, and LA
    can immensely benefit from the AI and also help the advancement of the
    technology because of its diverse nature- population, industries, ...

* LSU has a long running state-of-the-art HPC program and resources

  * SC presence
  * TOP 500
  * Rostam (CCT)

## Research

### Theory

* 2nd order optimizations for high precision mapping and avoiding numerical
  problems.
* Polyhedral
* Security (profiling info?)

### Technology

* AI driven runtime system
* HPX asynchronous execution + dataflow model to maximize parallelism and
  concurrency
* Security

## Enabling Technologies

* HPX
  * C++ standard conforming API for concurrency and parallelism

* APEX
  * provides any performance data you may need
  * dynamic execution policy interface (API?) for HPX and more

* Traveler
  * fluid human machine/data interface through intuitive visualization
  * helps us better understand and interact with the machine, a.k.a, AI

* Blaze
  1. executing array computations on HPX threads.
  2. its Smart Expression Tree can be used for better understanding of the
     computation and subsequently better scheduling decisions

* Phylanx
  * HPX's distributed array processing library. It is worth mentioning that it
    is heavily based on the Blaze math library which in turn uses HPX threads
    for execution

* PhySL (Phylanx Specialization Language)
  * first **specialization language** allowing **asynchronous execution** of
    python code on AMTs (tested with HPX)

* [JetLag](https://www.cct.lsu.edu/~sbrandt/JetLag-Talk-PyHPC2020.mp4)
  * Usability; easy access to any computation resource including science
    gateways

  * [talk](https://www.cct.lsu.edu/~sbrandt/JetLag-Talk-PyHPC2020.mp4)

## Facilities

* CCT
  * quantum mission and its importance in AI advancements
  * interdisciplinary nature
  * LIGO
  * LaSIGMA
  * Phylanx
  * Number of Graduate students
    * in each area
    * STE||AR group, diversity, ...
  * SC presence:
    * exhibition
    * Conference
    * Panels
    * Workshops

* Rostam
* Digital media center, state of the art, ready to host conferences and events,
 ...

## Community Impacts

### Economics

* helps to retain and atract high skilled workers
* as well as many others working in association with CCT may now be affected by
  the economic impact of the COVID crisis and budget cuts

### Education

* Find a partner in smaller schools
* CCT education, outreach and training program
